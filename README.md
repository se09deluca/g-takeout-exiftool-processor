## What are these scripts?

The update_metadata.sh and update_metadata_verbose.sh scripts are shell scripts useful for adding metadata to image and video files downloaded from Google (e.g. Google Photos) via Google Takeout.
Google Takeout generates zip files with assets and metadata placed in JSON files.
These scripts do not manage collages and any other files auto-generated by Google.
To avoid taking up too much space and going out of space, the script updates the original files and moves them directly to the destination folder (in a flat manner), it does not make a copy. 

Being little tested, it is recommended to keep the original zip files until you are satisfied with the result.
